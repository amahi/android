## Code style and structure

* Set the Code Style Scheme to `Default` in Android Studio settings.
* Run `Reformat Code` on changed files before committing.
* Please check out the [Code Style for Contributors](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html) section in AOSP and maintain as much consistency with them as possible.

## Getting Started

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change.
2. Fork the repository on GitHub.
3. Clone the fork : `git clone https://github.com/your-username/android.git`

## Making Changes

    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to the branch in your fork of the repository.
