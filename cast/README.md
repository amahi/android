# Chromecast styled receiver support files

URL for hosting the main CSS and images:

 * production: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/amahi/android@e845b6f7/cast/style.css`
 * development: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/amahi/android@master/cast/style.css`

We had to change from raw.githubusercontent because it sent response with content-type as `text/plain`, however we required it as `text/css` for Chromecast to accept the CSS properly.
